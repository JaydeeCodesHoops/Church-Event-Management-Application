# Church Event Management Application

## A bit of Myself
I am a junior Full-Stack developer that has built this project to gain more experience in the languages (REACT), (C#), (SSMS) and it has been quite fun building it, 
it has  been very stressful in the process but one major soft-skill that I have learnt was to never complicate simple work. 
Even in the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## 📌 Description
This is a webb application that lists events for a church and allows congregants of the church to select if they will be attending the event or not, 
this makes it easier for the user with the Admin role to track attendance for each event for catering purposes etc, 
it is a very simple and efficient web application to operate.
